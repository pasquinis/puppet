## Stuff used to make this:
 * [puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/)



### Setting up Git

* Tell Git your _name_ so your commits will be properly labeled. Type everything after the `$` here:
 
```$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"```
* Tell Git the _email address_ that will be associated with your Git commits.
 
```git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"```

### Testing your Git SSH connection

```bash
$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi pasquinis! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
